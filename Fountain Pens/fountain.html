        <center><h1>Top 10 fountain Pens for Newbies</h1></center>
            <p class="intro">Even though it's been years since I was a complete newbie in the fountain pen world, I still remember very distinctly how incredibly overwhelming all of the options seemed. Especially if you're shopping online, all of the different pens and their features all sort of seem to blend together and it can be paralyzing. Fountain pens are such a personal thing, and while you don't always know what will be the ultimate perfect pen for you, it's best to start out with a reliable writer that is a good introduction to the hobby.
        
            After years of experience using hundreds of different pens and talking with thousands of customers, I have compiled my personal list of what I feel are some of the best fountain pens to consider for the newbie just getting into the hobby. While I didn't use any scientific reasoning, the main criteria I used were value, reliability (especially in writing), and positive reputation.
        
            All of the fountain pens on this list can be found for under 300 aed.</p>
        <p>Without Further Ado....</p>
        <div>
            <h2>1. Pilot Metropolitan</h2>
            <p>Incredibly popular since its release, the reliable and durable metal-bodied <a target="_blank"href="https://www.amazon.ae/Pilot-Metropolitan-Fountain-Pen-Zig-Zag/dp/B08QGQLLP1/ref=sr_1_9?crid=3JUZYUCER8WYG&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.ksus1AlCPSJoi7ug-MTJdxFoWRoSvsz79vSaH2-ygKxC4LGjZzdY-ZGsOPy-cmGijaVi6ifExXX9oBoQJupI203UC44-qOTNdFeoIZdbiup5Z7qYPdGBLfqlG3ffTvmSpdjy2Riw49IoCdYgM-WTh1Hx1ZM-wnUre0wIVo70Ne9HwIbs6OBjNpGu8uCVoZHPl4x7JI_xVowEZmVV6yIn1FUuEUo-OZkbgCXI2wn7ehqeiIrxY0JOTH0Xlpvr6KLRBTjUK65_hoYj1MTBhI78yxKYw1ORLNNaxiRTdWbLddU.d5qgFFUzrsNte0Uc8_b743T3XKhMhUa-BpPB9tAEgn0&dib_tag=se&keywords=Pilot%2BMetropolitan%2BFountain%2BPens&qid=1709977221&sprefix=pilot%2Bmetropolitan%2Bfountain%2Bpens%2Caps%2C431&sr=8-9&th=1">Pilot Metropolitan fountain pen</a> is available in a wide range of colors and styles.

            <h2>5. LAMY safari</h2>
            <p>One of the top recommended starter fountain pens, with good reason.

From the triangular grip for ease of properly holding the pen, to the huge range of colors (including annual special editions), to the swappable nibs... there are a lot of reasons to like this pen.
